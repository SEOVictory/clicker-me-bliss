A clicker game designed to be played by bots or people.

Examples of Python code and javascript are in the repo.

The Python code uses selenium, which could also be written in ruby, php,
or any other language supported with selenium.

The Javascript can either be stateless or stateful. You can insert
your javscript code at the bottom of the page **before** clicking
play.
